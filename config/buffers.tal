( This label is used as the initial address of the symbol table, you must
update it's value by adding all the padding for the following buffers and then
substracting that value to `fb4a`, which is the address at which `@syms` begin
if no other operator defined buffers are included.

## Example

@syms    @buff
0xfb4a - 0x10 = 0xfb40 ->  |fb40 @syms )

(
&|buffers )
%BUFF { $10 }

@buff BUFF
